# Intro

*Builders Leaders* is a **simple platform** enabling **closed community of builders** (engineering, product & team) **leaders** grow by sharing experience and learning **across organizational** and **physical borders**.

In a repeating 2-weeks **sprints** (cycles) we solicit **biggest challenges** every **builder faces**, pair them with the most **suitable leaders** then **consult** in a 1:1 or panel **mentoring sessions** and **persist takeaways** in a collaborative [buildersleaders/playbook](https://github.com/buildersleaders/playbook).
	
## Request Access

We are open to new members, please **request access** to private section (sprint mailing list & playbook) by filling in this [Typeform](http://buildersleaders.com/).


# How it Works


### People

We **do NOT distinguish between mentors** and **mentees**. We believe that everyone can grow by understanding other's experiences.

### Platform
With **efficiency in mind**, we prefer tools that are **close to every builder**

 - [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/) surveys (challenges solicitation, mentors pairing)
 - [Zoom](https://zoom.us) (mentoring sessions)
 - [Github](https://github.com/buildersleaders) (takeaway documentation)
 - [Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T0137829UG6/C012Z7T3M3R) (coordination, announcements)

### Process

Growing as a leader means constantly facing new challenges. In order to synchronize *Builders Leaders* mentoring with your current challenges we operate in repeating **2-weeks sprints**.
 
 The **goal** of each sprint is to **resolve** and **document** takeaways of **all challenges** the **builders** currently **face** and move forward.
 
In order to achieve this within 2 weeks we stick to a **predefined schedule**.

TODO: Re-draw to calendar-style schema.
